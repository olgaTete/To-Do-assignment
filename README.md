Assignment To-do It 
Description 
You can also choose to do some additional work with the assignment. You will find that the 
instructions do not contain any frontend UI. The app is basically the business logic and nothing else. 
So you could add views to the app that would make it more interesting for a user when you run the 
app. Give the user the possibility to register new to-dos and assign to person. Add just a single user 
function or do something bigger, it’s up to you. Another thing missing from the instructions is a 
database connection. You will find references to static files standing in for a more permanent solution 
in the form of a database. So you could add a database and some framework connecting to the 
database, either in the form of Entity Framework or Dapper. If you are more interested now in getting 
the database to work, then focus on this part. 
If you choose to do extra work on top of the mandatory part, you should make some changes to the 
instructions. You should work with an MVC template instead, you could choose another folder 
structure that you find appropriate and you will have no use for the “PersonSequencer” class 
specified in the instructions. Basically, if you choose the extra work, you can be more free to design a 
to-do app that works when you run it.
